### Richard K. Guy

Richard K. Guy was a mathematician at the University of Calgary. He was [very passionate](https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/upload_library/22/Ford/Guy697-712.pdf) about small numbers. So passionate that he made some alliterations about how misleading they can be:

> Superficial similarities spawn spurious statements.
> Capricious coincidences cause careless conjectures.
> Early exceptions eclipse eventual essentials.
> Initial irregularities inhibit incisive intuition.

He coined the parody on the Law of Large Numbers, dubbed the Strong Law of Small Numbers:

> There aren't enough small numbers to meet the many demands made of them.

### There are two famous bioinformatics alignment algorithms

1. The Needleman-Wunsch global **alignment** algorithm.
    * This algorithm attempts to find the best alignment between two sequences.
2. The Smith-Waterman **local alignment** algorithm.
    * This algorithm attempts to find local alignments between two sequences, with the goal of finding sequences of homology easier.
